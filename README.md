# Edgegap Unreal Engine Build Utilities

## Motivation

Building Linux Servers with Unreal Engine no longer requires building Unreal Engine from source!
- faster builds: down from 2.5 hours to 8.5 minutes,
- smaller builds: only includes critical files,
- less bugs: same build environment regardless of your dev machine.
